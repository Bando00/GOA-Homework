         <h1 style="color: ghostwhite; font-size: large; background-color: darkblue; text-align: left;"> A new generation of low-emission aircraft will be built with lightweight, durable and sustainably sourced materials such as advanced composites, bio-fibres  and bio-sourced resins.  

            Design choices will extend to the future aircraft’s overall architecture, from engines and their position on the airframe to wing span and even foldable wingtips. Each choice must optimise aerodynamic efficiency.
            
            Propulsion systems are another key consideration in future performance, ranging from SAF-ready open fan rotors to hydrogen fuel cells that provide electrical power. The circularity of each material and technology option over the aircraft’s entire lifetime weighs heavily in the overall design choices Airbus’ engineers will make.
            
            Finally, keeping in mind the full product life cycle, manufacturing the aircraft at high volumes must be straightforward, and operating it must be cost effective. This can be enabled through digitalisation, improved connectivity and increased autonomy.</h1>
