            <p><h1>This website is about japan cars specifically <u>GTR r32</u>.The eighth generation Skyline R32 was rolled out in May 1989. Three months later, the “GT-R” was brought back after the 16-year absence. The engine was a specially designed “RB26DETT” of 2.6-liter
                 inline 6-cylinder DOHC twin turbo and generated maximum power of 280ps. The drive system was called “ATTESA E-TS” that was the electronically controlled 
                trque split 4WD which transmitted the best torque to all the wheels. It even had the 4-wheel multilink suspension. These equipment realized one of the
                 best performances all over the world as a sedan-based sport car. This GT-R has a record of amazing 29 victories and no
                  defeat for 4 seasons at Japan Touring Car Championship from 1990 through 1993.
